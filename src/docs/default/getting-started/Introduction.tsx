        Starting a new project can be burdensome. The{" "}
        <strong>create-qortal-app</strong> framework helps developers jump-start
        their app logic in under a minute with just a few simple steps. Building

        QDN (Qortal Data Network) is the backbone of app functionality on
        Qortal. Displaying content like JSON, videos, and images efficiently
        requires specific logic. This framework handles most of that for you, so
        you can focus on building features, not infrastructure.

        Many Qortal apps share similar logic. This framework centralizes that
        functionality, reducing code duplication and helping you stay DRY (Don't
        Repeat Yourself) across your projects.
